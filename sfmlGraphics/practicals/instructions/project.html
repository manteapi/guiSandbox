            <p> This worksheet describes the project assignment you will supply for the end of semester.
                You will work on this project during the practical sessions.
                You are asked to provide solutions for the modeling, rendering, animation and interaction of a 3D kart game.
                You will present your work during a short defence at the end of the semester.
                Please check this page periodically for additional guidelines, as we will update it.
            </p>

            <h2> 1. Practicalities </h2>
            
            <h3> 1.1 Grading Criteria </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Pertinence of proposed choices and solutions </li>
                <li> Quality and difficulty of implemented techniques </li>
                <li> Elegance and efficiency of the proposed code </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3> 1.2 Teamwork </h3>
            <p> Projects are made by groups of <strong>three</strong> students. 
                For parity reasons, a small number of two students groups are allowed.
                The project is meant to be done in teamwork, this will be verified during the presentation.
                If a difficulty arises in the group, be sure to notify it to your professor as soon as possible (i.e. not the day before the assignment deadline).
                Be efficient during the practical sessions as it might save a great quantity of time, that you might use for other semester projects.
                <strong>Do not wait until the last minute! </strong>
            </p>
            
            <h3> 1.3 Project deposit </h3>
            <p> You will deposit an archive of your project on Teide on <strong>Friday 15th April</strong>.
                The code must easily compile and run on Ensimag PCs as reference platform.
                You can still code at home as long as you ensure compatibility.
                The archive can also contain a presentation video of your project to showcase the behavior of your program.
            </p>
            
            <p> The archive should be name according to the following pattern: <code class="bash">3DCG_name1_name2_name3.tgz</code>,
            where <code class="bash">name*</code> are group member last names. This archive should decompress as a folder named
            <code class="bash">3DCG_name1_name2_name3/</code>. Please, avoid spaces (replace them with -) and any non US ASCII character
            in the names. The code should compile and execute the same way the practical codes do:</p>
            
            <pre><code class="bash">mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ..
make                
./main</code></pre> 
            <p> Every year, students ignore these rules. 
                Keep in mind that we will have a bunch of projects to examine and grade. 
                It saves us a lot of time if we can process your projects with scripts, e.g. to compile and launch the binaries.
                Also, the naming convention ensure we will not have issues <strong>1)</strong> knowing who worked on the project
                and <strong>2)</strong> opening the archive. For such reasons, ignoring those rules might severely reduce our
                ability to enjoy your work.  
            </p>
            
            <h3> 1.4 Presentations </h3>
            <p> Each group will present its project in front of professors and the remaining of the class. 
                They will make a demonstration of the project based on the code put on Teide. 
                The whole presentation will last 10-15 minutes and will cover the work, the ideas and contributions,
                including perhaps code fragments that illustrate the choices.
                You may prepare a set of slides to go along with the presentation, but this is not mandatory.
                However, we expect to see a live demonstration of the project and may ask to navigate the code.
            </p>        
            
            <h2> Subject description (TODO)</h2>
            
            <h3> General Guidelines </h3>
            <p> This year's project will be interactive: a 3D kart game. You will have to model the karts, the drivers, the roads and the level. There will be at least two drivers: one controlled by the computer and the other one by a human.
            </p>
            
            <h3> Minimal project content </h3>
            <h4>Modeling</h4>
            <ul>    
                <li> Model at least one kart with <strong>basic</strong> primitives</li>
                <li> Model at least one driver with <strong>basic</strong> primitives.</li>
                <li> Model a terrain for the road.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Animation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Keyboard control of one of the cart</li>
                <li>Kinematic animation of the driver (eg: win/lose/attack/break/turn/... events).</li>
                <li>Physics-based animation effects (eg: smoke, obstacles, projectile, collisions...).</li>
                <li>Non-human kart should at least follow a predetermined trajectory.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Rendering</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Textured objects</li>
                <li>Billboards</li>
                <li>Several lights and materials</li>
            </ul>
